Low-resolution outlines of land areas worldwide, stored as polygons in
shapefile format with coordinates in latitude (Y) and longitude (X) in
degrees.  The polygons include both exterior and interior coastlines.  A
'Name' attribute provides names for continents and larger islands.  The
coordinate sampling is equivalent to a scale of 1:30,000,000.  This data
set is suitable for global displays.

Agency (NGA), formerly National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).
